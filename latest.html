          mind</h5>
        <p class="card-text">It might cost around $3 million per month for OpenAI to run ChatGPT.</p>
        <div class="collapse mb-3" id="collapseWidthExample1">
          ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot, capable of creating interaction-style conversation. Developed by OpenAI,
          ChatGPT is known for its human-like responses and the best part about it is the fact that it is available for
          free. While you might be able to access ChatGPT for free, OpenAI is actually spending a lot of money to keep
          ChatGPT up and running. <br><br>
          According to the analysis, ChatGPT is hosted on Microsoft’s Azur cloud, so, OpenAI doesn’t have to buy a setup
          physical server room. As per the current rate, Microsoft charges $3 an hour for a single A100 GPU and each
          word generated on ChatGPT costs $0.0003. <br><br>
          A response from ChatGPT will usually have at least 30 words, hence, a single response from ChatGPT will cost
          at least 1 cent to the company. Currently, it is estimated that OpenAI is spending at least $100K per day or
          $3 million per month on running costs.

          2022</h5>
        <p class="card-text">This year, tech companies including Amazon, Meta, Twitter, and many others have together

        <div class="collapse mb-3" id="collapseWidthExample2">
          The tech industry has not had a smooth ride, with over a lakh people losing their jobs in 2022. The economic
          downturn has forced many big tech companies to trim their workforce. While some employees have faced the
          consequences of companies over-hiring during the pandemic, some have been deemed unwanted by new management.
          This year, tech companies including Amazon, Meta, Twitter, and many others have together parted ways with over
          a lakh employees. Most of the employees who lost their jobs in the US were on H1-B visas, which require
          employees to find a job within 60 days or leave the country. <br> <br>
          In India, particularly, ed-tech startups have struggled to keep up with the changing demands of society in a
          post-COVID era. At the beginning of 2022, many offices and schools reopened due to a steep decline in COVID
          cases. The reopening of schools and colleges has had a deep impact on the business of ed-tech platforms like
          Byjus, Vedantu, and Unacademy, among others.

        <p class="card-text">Google wants to help people crack badly handwritten prescriptions from doctors. Here is
          everything you need to know.</p>
        <div class="collapse mb-3" id="collapseWidthExample3">
          Google today hosted an event in India and announced quite a few features that will be made available for
          Indians. These include some of the new search-related features, better security for Google Pay users, and
          more. The company also wants to help people crack badly handwritten prescriptions from doctors. Here is
          everything you need to know. <br> <br>
          The search giant asserted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will help people
          identify and highlight medicines within handwritten prescriptions. The new feature will be accessible to users
          via Google Lens. People will just be required to click a picture of the prescription and then upload it to the
          photo library. Once done, the app will then detect the image of the prescription and reveal the details of the
          medicines mentioned in the paper. <br> <br>
          "This will act as an assistive technology for digitizing handwritten medical documents by augmenting the
          humans in the loop such as pharmacists, however, no decision will be made solely based on the output provided
          by this technology," Google said. <br> <br>
          The company hasn't yet revealed details of when it plans to release this feature to everyone. Google is saying
          that it is working with pharmacists to offer a better understanding of prescriptions to users. We should get
          more clarity on this in the coming weeks. In the world, Google noted that Indians have mostly used Google lens
          for different use cases. This might have inspired the company to offer users more AI tools for more
          convenience.
